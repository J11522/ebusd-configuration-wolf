Please find here some ebusd configuration files for my Wolf heating system.

Verified:
- CHA 07/10 (Field "CHA Status" is still work in progress, since I have some difficulty with decode this bitmask in ebusd. Might have to do some post-processing here in Node-RED)

Might come soon:
- MM-2

Note: configuration files mostly include only status fields. Configuration parameters are intentionally not included.
